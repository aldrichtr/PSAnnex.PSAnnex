## SYNOPSIS

A collection of PowerShell modules for everyday work.  Over the years I have collected, modified and authored many
functions that help with life on the PowerShell command-line, and some tools that i use everyday (Windows Terminal,
VSCode, etc.)
PSAnnex is an "umbrella module".  It does not actually have any functions or objects on its own.  All of the
functionality is divided into nested modules.
